    <h2>JavaScript, the "devil" among var, let, and const would likely be considered (var) due to its quirky behavior and potential for confusion. Here's why:
        Scope Issues with var:
        var has function scope (not block scope). This can cause unexpected behavior, especially when used inside loops or conditionals, as the variable will be available throughout the function even if you intended to limit its scope to a block.
        </h2>
        <h2>var is considered the "devil" because of its unexpected behavior, particularly with scoping and hoisting. In modern JavaScript development, let and const are favored because they provide cleaner, more predictable code.</h2>
